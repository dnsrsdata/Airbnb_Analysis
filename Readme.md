## Installations
Follow the steps below to be able to play the project locally.

The Python version used in this project is 3.9.13. In order for the project to play smoothly, I suggest you are using the same version.

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dnsrsdata/Airbnb_Analysis.git
   ```
2. install the packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Project Motivation
The idea for this project came from Udacity, where this is the first project proposed by Nanodegree. I chose to choose data from Rio de Janeiro because I am Brazilian, and therefore I found it interesting to work with data from my country.

## File Descriptions
    ├── data               <- The original, immutable data dump.
    ├── notebooks          <- Contain Jupyter notebooks.
    ├── README.md          <- The top-level README for developers using this project.
    ├── requirements.txt   <- The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment, e.g.
    │                         generated with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

## Results
Coming Soon...
